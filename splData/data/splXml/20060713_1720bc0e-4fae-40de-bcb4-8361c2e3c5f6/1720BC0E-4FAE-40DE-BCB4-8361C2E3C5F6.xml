<text><paragraph>EDECRIN acts on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle
and on the proximal and distal tubules. Urinary output is usually dose dependent
and related to the magnitude of fluid accumulation. Water and electrolyte
excretion may be increased several times over that observed with thiazide
diuretics, since EDECRIN inhibits reabsorption of a much greater proportion
of filtered sodium than most other diuretic agents. Therefore, EDECRIN is
effective in many patients who have significant degrees of renal insufficiency
(see <linkHtml href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</linkHtml> concerning deafness).
EDECRIN has little or no effect on glomerular filtration or on renal blood
flow, except following pronounced reductions in plasma volume when associated
with rapid diuresis.</paragraph><paragraph>The electrolyte excretion pattern
of ethacrynic acid varies from that of the thiazides and mercurial diuretics.
Initial sodium and chloride excretion is usually substantial and chloride
loss exceeds that of sodium. With prolonged administration, chloride excretion
declines, and potassium and hydrogen ion excretion may increase. EDECRIN is
effective whether or not there is clinical acidosis or alkalosis.</paragraph><paragraph>Although
EDECRIN, in carefully controlled studies in animals and experimental subjects,produces a more favorable sodium/potassium excretion ratio than the thiazides,
in patients with increased diuresis excessive amounts of potassium may be
excreted.</paragraph><paragraph>Onset of action is rapid, usually within 30
minutes after an oral dose of EDECRIN or within 5 minutes after an intravenous
injection of SODIUM EDECRIN. After oral use, diuresis peaks in about 2 hours
and lasts about 6 to 8 hours.</paragraph><paragraph>The sulfhydryl binding
propensity of ethacrynic acid differs somewhat from that of the organomercurials.
Its mode of action is not by carbonic anhydrase inhibition.</paragraph><paragraph>Ethacrynic
acid does not cross the blood-brain barrier.</paragraph></text>

<text><paragraph>The effects of EDECRIN on electrolytes are related to its
renal pharmacologic activity and are dose dependent. The possibility of profound
electrolyte and water loss may be avoided by weighing the patient throughout
the treatment period, by careful adjustment of dosage, by initiating treatment
with small doses, and by using the drug on an intermittent schedule when possible.
When excessive diuresis occurs, the drug should be withdrawn until homeostasis
is restored. When excessive electrolyte loss occurs, the dosage should be
reduced or the drug temporarily withdrawn.</paragraph><paragraph>Initiation
of diuretic therapy with EDECRIN in the cirrhotic patient with ascites is
best carried out in the hospital. When maintenance therapy has been established,
the individual can be satisfactorily followed as an outpatient.</paragraph><paragraph>EDECRIN
should be given with caution to patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver,
particularly those with a history of previous episodes of electrolyte imbalance
or hepatic encephalopathy. Like other diuretics it may precipitate hepatic
coma and death.</paragraph><paragraph>Too vigorous a diuresis, as evidenced
by rapid and excessive weight loss, may induce an acute hypotensive episode.
In elderly cardiac patients, rapid contraction of plasma volume and the resultant
hemoconcentration should be avoided to prevent the development of thromboembolic
episodes, such as cerebral vascular thromboses and pulmonary emboli which
may be fatal. Excessive loss of potassium in patients receiving digitalis
glycosides may precipitate digitalis toxicity. Care should also be exercised
in patients receiving potassium-depleting steroids.</paragraph><paragraph>A
number of possibly drug-related deaths have occurred in critically ill patients
refractory to other diuretics. These generally have fallen into two categories:
(1) patients with severe myocardial disease who have been receiving digitalis
and presumably developed acute hypokalemia with fatal arrhythmia; (2) patients
with severely decompensated hepatic cirrhosis with ascites, with or without
accompanying encephalopathy, who were in electrolyte imbalance and died because
of intensification of the electrolyte defect.</paragraph><paragraph>Deafness,
tinnitus, and vertigo with a sense of fullness in the ears have occurred,
most frequently in patients with severe impairment of renal function. These
symptoms have been associated most often with intravenous administration and
with doses in excess of those recommended. The deafness has usually been reversible
and of short duration (one to 24 hours). However, in some patients the hearing
loss has been permanent. A number of these patients were also receiving drugs
known to be ototoxic. EDECRIN may increase the ototoxic potential of other
drugs (see <linkHtml href="#PRECAUTIONS">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</linkHtml>).</paragraph><paragraph>Lithium
generally should not be given with diuretics (see <linkHtml href="#PRECAUTIONS">PRECAUTIONS,
Drug Interactions</linkHtml>).</paragraph></text>

<text><paragraph>Weakness, muscle cramps, paresthesias, thirst, anorexia,
and signs of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and/or hypochloremic alkalosis may
occur following vigorous or excessive diuresis and these may be accentuated
by rigid salt restriction. Rarely, tetany has been reported following vigorous
diuresis. <content styleCode="italics">During therapy with ethacrynic acid,
liberalization of salt intake and supplementary potassium chloride are often
necessary.</content></paragraph><paragraph>When a metabolic alkalosis may
be anticipated, e.g., in cirrhosis with ascites, the use of potassium chloride
or a potassium-sparing agent before and during therapy with EDECRIN may mitigate
or prevent the hypokalemia.</paragraph><paragraph>Loop diuretics have been
shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.</paragraph><paragraph>The
safety and efficacy of ethacrynic acid in hypertension have not been established.
However, the dosage of coadministered antihypertensive agents may require
adjustment.</paragraph><paragraph>Orthostatic hypotension may occur in patients
receiving other antihypertensive agents when given ethacrynic acid.</paragraph><paragraph>EDECRIN
has little or no effect on glomerular filtration or on renal blood flow, except
following pronounced reductions in plasma volume when associated with rapid
diuresis. A transient increase in serum urea nitrogen may occur. Usually,
this is readily reversible when the drug is discontinued.</paragraph><paragraph>As
with other diuretics used in the treatment of renal edema, hypoproteinemia
may reduce responsiveness to ethacrynic acid and the use of salt-poor albumin
should be considered.</paragraph><paragraph>A number of drugs, including ethacrynic
acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein; a reduction
in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be required in patients receiving both
drugs.</paragraph><paragraph>EDECRIN may increase the risk of gastric hemorrhage
associated with corticosteroid treatment.</paragraph></text>

<text><paragraph>Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because
they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Read
circulars for lithium preparations before use of such concomitant therapy.</paragraph><paragraph>EDECRIN
may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs such as aminoglycoside
and some cephalosporin antibiotics. Their concurrent use should be avoided.</paragraph><paragraph>A
number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin
from plasma protein; a reduction in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be
required in patients receiving both drugs.</paragraph><paragraph>In some patients,
the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the
diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing
and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when EDECRIN and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine
if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.</paragraph></text>

is recommended. Onset of diuresis usually occurs at 50 to 100 mg for adults.After diuresis has been achieved, the minimally effective dose (usually from

<title mediaType="text/x-hl7-title+xml">Maintenance Therapy</title>
<text><paragraph>It is usually possible to reduce the dosage and frequency
of administration once dry weight has been achieved.</paragraph><paragraph><content styleCode="italics">EDECRIN (Ethacrynic Acid) may be given intermittently
after an effective diuresis is obtained with the regimen outlined above. </content>Dosage may be on an alternate daily schedule or more prolongedperiods of diuretic therapy may be interspersed with rest periods. Such an
intermittent dosage schedule allows time for correction of any electrolyte
imbalance and may provide a more efficient diuretic response.</paragraph><paragraph>The
chloruretic effect of this agent may give rise to retention of bicarbonate
and a metabolic alkalosis. This may be corrected by giving chloride (ammonium
chloride or arginine chloride). Ammonium chloride should not be given to cirrhotic
patients.</paragraph><paragraph>EDECRIN has additive effects when used with
other diuretics. For example, a patient who is on maintenance dosage of an
oral diuretic may require additional intermittent diuretic therapy, such as
an organomercurial, for the maintenance of basal weight. The intermittent
use of EDECRIN orally may eliminate the need for injections of organomercurials.
Small doses of EDECRIN may be added to existing diuretic regimens to maintain
basal weight. This drug may potentiate the action of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,
with augmentation of natriuresis and kaliuresis. Therefore, when adding EDECRIN
the initial dose and changes of dose should be in 25 mg increments, to avoid
electrolyte depletion. Rarely, patients who failed to respond to ethacrynic
acid have responded to older established agents.</paragraph><paragraph>While
many patients do not require supplemental potassium, the use of potassium
chloride or potassium-sparing agents, or both, during treatment with EDECRIN
is advisable, especially in cirrhotic or nephrotic patients and in patients
receiving digitalis.</paragraph><paragraph>Salt liberalization usually prevents
the development of hyponatremia and hypochloremia. During treatment with EDECRIN,
salt may be liberalized to a greater extent than with other diuretics. Cirrhotic
patients, however, usually require at least moderate salt restriction concomitant
with diuretic therapy.</paragraph></text>
