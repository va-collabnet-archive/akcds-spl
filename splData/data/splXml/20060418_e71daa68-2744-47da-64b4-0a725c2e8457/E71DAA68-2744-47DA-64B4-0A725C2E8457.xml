					<text>
						<paragraph>Bumetanide is a loop diuretic with a rapid onset and short
duration of action. Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that 1
mg bumetanide has a diuretic potency equivalent to approximately 40 mg furosemide.
The major site of bumetanide action is the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.</paragraph>
						<paragraph>	The
mode of action has been determined through various clearance studies in both
humans and experimental animals. Bumetanide inhibits sodium reabsorption in
the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, as shown by marked reduction of free-water
clearance (<sup>C</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O) during hydration and tubular free-water
reabsorption (T<sup>C</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O) during hydropenia. Reabsorption
of chloride in the ascending limb is also blocked by bumetanide, and bumetanide
is somewhat more chloruretic than natriuretic.</paragraph>
						<paragraph>	Potassium
excretion is also increased by bumetanide, in a dose-related fashion.</paragraph>
						<paragraph>	Bumetanide
may have an additional action in the proximal tubule. Since phosphate reabsorption
takes place largely in the proximal tubule, phosphaturia during bumetanide-induced
diuresis is indicative of this additional action. This is further supported
by the reduction in the renal clearance of bumetanide by probenecid, associated
with diminution in the natriuretic response. This proximal tubular activity
does not seem to be related to an inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Bumetanide
does not appear to have a noticeable action on the distal tubule.</paragraph>
						<paragraph>	Bumetanide
decreases uric acid excretion and increases serum uric acid. Diuresis starts
within minutes following an intravenous injection and reaches maximum levels
within 15 to 30 minutes.</paragraph>
						<paragraph>	Several pharmacokinetic studies
have shown that bumetanide, administered orally or parenterally, is eliminated
rapidly in humans, with a half-life of between 1 and 1&#189; hours. Plasma
protein-binding is in the range of 94% to 96%.</paragraph>
						<paragraph>	Oral
administration of carbon-14 labeled bumetanide to human volunteers revealed
that 81% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in the urine, 45%
of it as unchanged drug. Urinary and biliary metabolites identified in this
study were formed by oxidation of the N-butyl side chain. Biliary excretion
of bumetanide amounted to only 2% of the administered dose.</paragraph>
						<paragraph>
							<content styleCode="bold">Pediatric Pharmacology: </content>
						</paragraph>
						<paragraph>Elimination
of bumetanide appears to be considerably slower in neonatal patients compared
with adults, possibly because of immature renal and hepatobiliary function
in this population. Small phamacokinetic studies of intravenous bumetanide
in preterm and full-term neonates with respiratory disorders have reported
an apparent half-life of approximately 6 hours with a range up to 15 hours
and a serum clearance ranging from 0.2 to 1.1 mL/min/kg. In a population of
neonates receiving bumetanide for volume overload, mean serum clearance rates
were 2.17 mL/min/kg in patients less than 2 months of age and 3.8 mL/min/kg
in patients aged 2 to 6 months. Mean serum half-life of bumetanide was 2.5
hours and 1.5 hours in patients aged less than 2 months and those aged 2 to
6 months, respectively. Elimination half-life decreased considerably during
the first month of life, from a mean of approximately 6 hours at birth to
approximately 2.4 hours at 1 month of age.</paragraph>
						<paragraph>	In preterm
neonates, mean serum concentrations following a single 0.05 mg/kg dose ranged
from 126 mcg/L at 1 hour to 57 mcg/L at 8 hours. In another study, mean serum
concentrations following a single 0.05 mg/kg dose were 338 ng/mL at 30 minutes
and 176 ng/mL after 4 hours. A single dose of 0.1 mg/kg produced mean serum
levels of 314 ng/mL at 1 hour, and 196 ng/mL at 6&#160;hours. Mean volume
of distribution in neonates has been reported to range from 0.26 L/kg to 0.39&#160;L/kg.</paragraph>
						<paragraph>	The
degree of protein binding of bumetanide in cord sera from healthy neonates
was approximately 97%, suggesting the potential for bilirubin displacement.
A study using pooled sera from critically ill neonates found that bumetanide
at concentrations of 0.5 to 50 mcg/mL, but not 0.25 mcg/mL, caused a linear
increase in unbound bilirubin concentrations.</paragraph>
						<paragraph>	In 56
infants aged 4 days to 6 months, bumetanide doses ranging from 0.005 mg/kg
to 0.1&#160;mg/kg were studied for pharmacodynamic effect. Peak bumetanide
excretion rates increased linearly with increasing doses of drug. Maximal
diuretic effect was observed at a bumetanide excretion rate of about 7 mcg/kg/hr,
corresponding to doses of 0.035 to 0.040 mg/kg. Higher doses produced a higher
bumetanide excretion rate but no increase in diuretic effect. Urine flow rate
peaked during the first hour after drug administration in 80%
of patients and by 3 hours in all patients.</paragraph>
						<paragraph>
							<content styleCode="bold">Geriatric Pharmacology:</content>
						</paragraph>
						<paragraph>In
a group of ten geriatric subjects between the ages of 65 and 73 years, total
bumetanide clearance was significantly lower (1.8 &#177; 0.3 mL/min/kg) compared
with younger subjects (2.9&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#160;mL/min/kg) after a single
oral bumetanide 0.5 mg dose. Maximum plasma concentrations were higher in
geriatric subjects (16.9 &#177; 1.8 ng/mL) compared with younger subjects
(10.3 &#177; 1.5 ng/mL). Urine flow rate and total excretion of sodium and
potassium were increased less in the geriatric subjects compared with younger
subjects, although potassium excretion and fractional sodium excretion were
similar between the two age groups. Nonrenal clearance, bioavailability, and
volume of distribution were not significantly different between the two groups.</paragraph>

can be used to induce diuresis in renal insufficiency, any marked increase
in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, or the development of oliguria during
therapy of patients with progressive renal disease, is an indication for discontinuation
of treatment with bumetanide. Bumetanide is also contraindicated in patients
in hepatic coma or in states of severe electrolyte depletion until the condition
is improved or corrected. Bumetanide is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive

					<text>
						<list listType="ordered">
							<item>
								<paragraph>&#160;Volume and electrolyte depletion. The dose of bumetanide
should be adjusted to the patient&#8217;s need. Excessive doses or too frequent
administration can lead to profound water loss, electrolyte depletion, dehydration,
reduction in blood volume and circulatory collapse with the possibility of
vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients.</paragraph>
							</item>
							<item>
								<paragraph>&#160;Hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can occur as a consequence
of bumetanide administration. Prevention of hypokalemia requires particular
attention in the following conditions: patients receiving digitalis and diuretics
for congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, states of aldosterone
excess with normal renal function, potassium-losing nephropathy, certain diarrheal
states, or other states where hypokalemia is thought to represent particular
added risks to the patient, <content styleCode="italics">i.e., </content>history
of ventricular arrhythmias.</paragraph>
								<paragraph>       In patients with
hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, sudden alterations of electrolyte balance may
precipitate hepatic encephalopathy and coma. Treatment in such patients is
best initiated in the hospital with small doses and careful monitoring of
the patient&#8217;s clinical status and electrolyte balance. Supplemental
potassium and/or spironolactone may prevent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis
in these patients.</paragraph>
							</item>
							<item>
								<paragraph>&#160;Ototoxicity. In cats, dogs, and guinea pigs, bumetanide
has been shown to produce ototoxicity. In these test animals bumetanide was
5 to 6 times more potent than furosemide and, since the diuretic potency of
bumetanide is about 40 to 60 times furosemide, it is anticipated that blood
levels necessary to produce ototoxicity will rarely be achieved. The potential
exists, however, and must be considered a risk of intravenous therapy, especially
at high doses, repeated frequently in the face of renal excretory function
impairment. Potentiation of aminoglycoside ototoxicity has not been tested
for bumetanide. Like other members of this class of diuretics, bumetanide
probably shares this risk.</paragraph>
							</item>
							<item>
								<paragraph>&#160;Allergy to sulfonamides. Patients allergic to sulfonamides
may show hypersensitivity to bumetanide.</paragraph>
							</item>
							<item>
								<paragraph>&#160;Thrombocytopenia. Since there have been rare spontaneous
reports of thrombocytopenia from postmarketing experience, patients should
be observed regularly for possible occurrence of thrombocytopenia.</paragraph>

									<item>
										<paragraph>&#160;Drugs with ototoxic potential (see <content styleCode="bold italics">WARNINGS</content>): Especially in the presence of impaired renal function, the use
of parenterally administered bumetanide in patients to whom aminoglycoside
antibiotics are also being given should be avoided, except in life-threatening
conditions.</paragraph>
									</item>
									<item>
										<paragraph>&#160;Drugs with nephrotoxic potential: There has been no
experience on the concurrent use of bumetanide with drugs known to have a
nephrotoxic potential. Therefore, the simultaneous administration of these
drugs should be avoided.</paragraph>
									</item>
									<item>
										<paragraph>&#160;Lithium: Lithium should generally not be given with
diuretics (such as bumetanide) because they reduce its renal clearance and
add a high risk of lithium toxicity.</paragraph>
									</item>
									<item>
										<paragraph>&#160;Probenecid: Pretreatment with probenecid reduces both
the natriuresis and hyperreninemia produced by bumetanide. This antagonistic
effect of probenecid on bumetanide natriuresis is not due to a direct action
on sodium excretion but is probably secondary to its inhibitory effect on
renal tubular secretion of bumetanide. Thus, probenecid should not be administered
concurrently with bumetanide.</paragraph>
									</item>
									<item>
										<paragraph>&#160;Indomethacin: Indomethacin blunts the increases in
urine volume and sodium excretion seen during bumetanide treatment and inhibits
the bumetanide-induced increase in plasma renin activity. Concurrent therapy
with bumetanide is thus not recommended.</paragraph>
									</item>
									<item>
										<paragraph>&#160;Antihypertensives: Bumetanide may potentiate the effect
of various antihypertensive drugs, necessitating a reduction in the dosage
of these drugs.</paragraph>
									</item>
									<item>
										<paragraph> Digoxin: Interaction studies in humans have shown no effect
on digoxin blood levels.</paragraph>
									</item>
									<item>
										<paragraph>&#160;Anticoagulants: Interaction studies in humans have
shown bumetanide to have no effect on warfarin metabolism or on plasma prothrombin
activity.</paragraph>

								<paragraph>Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Bumetanide is
neither teratogenic nor embryocidal in mice when given in doses up to 3400
times the maximum human therapeutic dose.</paragraph>
								<paragraph>	Bumetanide
has been shown to be nonteratogenic, but it has a slight embryocidal effect
in rats when given in doses of 3400 times the maximum human therapeutic dose
and in rabbits at doses of 3.4 times the maximum human therapeutic dose. In
one study, moderate growth retardation and increased incidence of delayed
ossification of sternebrae were observed in rats at oral doses of 100&#160;mg/kg/day,
3400 times the maximum human therapeutic dose. These effects were associated
with maternal weight reductions noted during dosing. No such adverse effects
were observed at 30&#160;mg/kg/day (1000 times the maximum human therapeutic
dose). No fetotoxicity was observed at 1000 to 2000 times the human therapeutic
dose.</paragraph>
								<paragraph>	In rabbits, a dose-related decrease in litter
size and an increase in resorption rate were noted at oral doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day
and 0.3 mg/kg/day (3.4 and 10 times the maximum human therapeutic dose). A
slightly increased incidence of delayed ossification of sternebrae occurred
at 0.3&#160;mg/kg/day; however, no such adverse effects were observed at the
dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day. The sensitivity of the rabbit to bumetanide parallels
the marked pharmacologic and toxicologic effects of the drug in this species.</paragraph>
								<paragraph>	Bumetanide
was not teratogenic in the hamster at an oral dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day (17 times
the maximum human therapeutic dose). Bumetanide was not teratogenic when given
intravenously to mice and rats at doses up to 140 times the maximum human
therapeutic dose.</paragraph>
								<paragraph>	There are no adequate and well-controlled
studies in pregnant women. A small investigational experience in the United
States and marketing experience in other countries to date have not indicated
any evidence of adverse effects on the fetus, but these data do not rule out
the possibility of harmful effects. Bumetanide should be given to a pregnant
woman only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</paragraph>

								<paragraph>Clinical studies of bumetanide did not include sufficient
numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently
from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified
differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general,
dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting
at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased
hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug
therapy.</paragraph>
								<paragraph>&#160;&#160;This drug is known to be substantially
excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be
greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients
are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in
dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</paragraph>
