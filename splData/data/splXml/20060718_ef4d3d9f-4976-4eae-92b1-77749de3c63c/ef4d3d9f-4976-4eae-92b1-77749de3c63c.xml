<title mediaType="text/x-hl7-title+xml">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</title>
<text><paragraph>In isolated nerve-muscle preparation, <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> has been shown to produce relaxation by affecting the contractile response of the muscle at a site beyond the myoneural junction.  In skeletal muscle, <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> dissociates the excitation-contraction coupling, probably by interfering with the release of Ca++ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  The administration of intravenous <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> to human volunteers is associated with loss of grip strength and weakness in the legs, as well as subjective CNS complaints (see also <linkHtml href="#s8">PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients</linkHtml>).  Information concerning the passage of <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> across the blood-brain barrier is not available.</paragraph><paragraph>In the anesthetic-induced malignant hyperthermia syndrome, evidence points to an intrinsic abnormality of skeletal muscle tissue.  In affected humans, it has been postulated that &#8220;triggering agents&#8221; (e.g., general anesthetics and depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents) produce a change within the cell which results in an elevated myoplasmic calcium.  This elevated myoplasmic calcium activates acute cellular catabolic processes that cascade to the malignant hyperthermia crisis.</paragraph><paragraph>It is hypothesized that addition of <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> to the &#8220;triggered&#8221; malignant hyperthermic muscle cell reestablishes a normal level of ionized calcium in the myoplasm.  Inhibition of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> reestablishes the myoplasmic calcium equilibrium, increasing the percentage of bound calcium.  In this way, physiologic, metabolic, and biochemical changes associated with the malignant hyperthermia crisis may be reversed or attenuated.  Experimental results in malignant hyperthermia susceptible swine show that prophylactic administration of intravenous or oral dantrolene prevents or attenuates the development of vital sign and blood gas changes characteristic of malignant hyperthermia in a dose related manner.  The efficacy of intravenous dantrolene in the treatment of human and porcine malignant hyperthermia crisis, when considered along with prophylactic experiments in malignant hyperthermia susceptible swine, lends support to prophylactic use of oral or intravenous dantrolene in malignant hyperthermia susceptible humans.  When prophylactic intravenous dantrolene is administered as directed, whole blood concentrations remain at a near steady state level for 3 or more hours after the infusion is completed.  Clinical experience has shown that early vital sign and/or blood gas changes characteristic of malignant hyperthermia may appear during or after anesthesia and surgery despite the prophylactic use of dantrolene and adherence to currently accepted patient management practices.  These signs are compatible with attenuated malignant hyperthermia and respond to the administration of additional i.v. dantrolene (see <linkHtml href="#s16">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>).  The administration of the recommended prophylactic dose of intravenous dantrolene to healthy volunteers was not associated with clinically significant cardiorespiratory changes.</paragraph><paragraph>Specific metabolic pathways for the degradation and elimination of <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> in humans have been established.  Dantrolene is found in measurable amounts in blood and urine.  Its major metabolites in body fluids are 5-hydroxy dantrolene and an acetylamino metabolite of dantrolene.  Another metabolite with an unknown structure appears related to the latter.  <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> may also undergo hydrolysis and subsequent oxidation forming nitrophenylfuroic acid.</paragraph><paragraph>The mean biologic half-life of <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> after intravenous administration is variable, between 4 to 8 hours under most experimental conditions.  Based on assays of whole blood and plasma, slightly greater amounts of dantrolene are associated with red blood cells than with the plasma fraction of blood.  Significant amounts of dantrolene are bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin, and this binding is readily reversible.</paragraph><paragraph>Cardiopulmonary depression has not been observed in malignant hyperthermia susceptible swine following the administration of up to 7.5 mg/kg i.v. dantrolene.  This is twice the amount needed to maximally diminish twitch response to single supramaximal peripheral nerve stimulation (95% inhibition).  A transient, inconsistent, depressant effect on gastrointestinal smooth muscles has been observed at high doses.</paragraph></text>

<text><paragraph>The use of <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium Intravenous</content><content styleCode="italics">in the management of malignant hyperthermia crisis is not a substitute for previously known supportive measures.  These measures must be individualized, but it will usually be necessary to discontinue the suspect triggering agents, attend to increased oxygen requirements, manage the metabolic acidosis, institute cooling when necessary, monitor urinary output, and monitor for electrolyte imbalance.</content></paragraph><paragraph>Since the effect of disease state and other drugs on  <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> related skeletal muscle weakness, including possible respiratory depression, cannot be predicted, patients who receive i.v. <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> preoperatively should have vital signs monitored.</paragraph><paragraph>If patients judged malignant hyperthermia susceptible are administered intravenous or oral <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> preoperatively, anesthetic preparation must still follow a standard malignant hyperthermia susceptible regimen, including the avoidance of known triggering agents.  Monitoring for early clinical and metabolic signs of malignant hyperthermia is indicated because attenuation of malignant hyperthermia, rather than prevention, is possible.

<text><paragraph><content styleCode="bold">Information for Patients:</content>  Based upon data in human volunteers, it will sometimes be appropriate to tell patients who receive <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium Intravenous</content> that decrease in grip strength and weakness of leg muscles, especially walking down stairs, can be expected postoperatively.  In addition, symptoms such as &#8220;lightheadedness&#8221; may be noted.  Since some of these symptoms may persist for up to 48 hours, patients must not operate an automobile or engage in other hazardous activity during this time.  Caution is also indicated at meals on the day of administration because difficulty swallowing and choking has been reported.  Caution should be exercised in the concomitant administration of tranquilizing agents.</paragraph><paragraph>Hepatotoxicity seen <content styleCode="bold">with Dantrium Capsules:  Dantrium</content> (dantrolene sodium) has a potential for hepatotoxicity, and should not be used in conditions other than those recommended.  Symptomatic hepatitis (fatal and non-fatal) has been reported at various dose levels of the drug.  The incidence reported in patients taking up to 400 mg/day is much lower than in those taking doses of 800 mg or more per day.  Even sporadic short courses of these higher dose levels within a treatment regimen markedly increased the risk of serious hepatic injury.  Liver dysfunction as evidenced by blood chemical abnormalities alone (liver enzyme elevations) has been observed in patients exposed to <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> for varying periods of time.  Overt hepatitis has occurred at varying intervals after initiation of therapy, but has been most frequently observed between the third and twelfth month of therapy.  The risk of hepatic injury appears to be greater in females, in patients over 35 years of age, and in patients taking other medication(s) in addition to <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> (dantrolene sodium).  <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> should be used only in conjunction with appropriate monitoring of hepatic function including frequent determination of SGOT or SGPT.</paragraph><paragraph>Fatal and non-fatal liver disorders of an idiosyncratic or hypersensitivity type may occur with <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> therapy.</paragraph></text>

<text><paragraph><content styleCode="bold">Drug Interactions:  Dantrium</content> is metabolized by the liver, and it is theoretically possible that its metabolism may be enhanced by drugs known to induce hepatic microsomal enzymes.  However, neither phenobarbital nor diazepam appears to affect <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> metabolism.  Binding to plasma protein is not significantly altered by diazepam, diphenylhydantoin, or phenylbutazone.  Binding to plasma proteins is reduced by warfarin and clofibrate and increased by tolbutamide.</paragraph><paragraph>Cardiovascular collapse in patients treated simultaneously with verapamil and dantrolene sodium is rare.  The combination of therapeutic doses of intravenous dantrolene sodium and verapamil in halothane/alpha-chloralose anesthetized swine has resulted in ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse in association with marked hyperkalemia.  It is recommended that the combination of intravenous dantrolene sodium and calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, not be used together during the management of malignant hyperthermia crisis until the relevance of these findings to humans is established.</paragraph><paragraph>Administration of dantrolene may potentiate vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block.</paragraph></text>

While 10 mg/kg/day in dogs for 14 days evoked little toxicity, 20 mg/kg/day for 14 days caused hepatic changes of questionable biologic significance.</paragraph><paragraph>Symptoms which may occur in case of overdose include, but are not limited to, muscular weakness and alterations in the state of consciousness (e.g., lethargy, coma), vomiting, diarrhea, and crystalluria.</paragraph><paragraph>For acute overdosage, general supportive measures should be employed.</paragraph><paragraph>Intravenous fluids should be administered in fairly large quantities to avert the possibility of crystalluria.  An adequate airway should be maintained and artificial resuscitation equipment should be at hand.  Electrocardiographic monitoring should be instituted, and the patient carefully observed.  The value of dialysis in <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium</content> overdose is not known.</paragraph></text>

<text><paragraph>As soon as the malignant hyperthermia reaction is recognized, all anesthetic agents should be discontinued; the administration of 100% oxygen is recommended.  <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium Intravenous</content> should be administered by continuous rapid intravenous push beginning at a minimum dose of 1 mg/kg, and continuing until symptoms subside or the maximum cumulative dose of 10 mg/kg has been reached.</paragraph><paragraph>If the physiologic and metabolic abnormalities reappear, the regimen may be repeated.  It is important to note that administration of <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium Intravenous</content> should be continuous until symptoms subside.  The effective dose to reverse the crisis is directly dependent upon the individual's degree of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, the amount and time of exposure to the triggering agent, and the time elapsed between onset of the crisis and initiation of treatment.</paragraph></text>

<text><paragraph>Each vial of <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium Intravenous</content> should be reconstituted by adding 60 mL of sterile water for injection USP (without a bacteriostatic agent), and the vial shaken until the solution is clear.  5% Dextrose Injection USP, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP, and other acidic solutions are not compatible with <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium Intravenous</content> and should not be used.  The contents of the vial must be protected from direct light and used within 6 hours after reconstitution.  Store reconstituted solutions at controlled room temperature (59&#176;F to 86&#176;F or 15&#176;C to 30&#176;C).</paragraph><paragraph>Reconstituted <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium Intravenous</content> should not be transferred to large glass bottles for prophylactic infusion due to precipitate formation observed with the use of some glass bottles as reservoirs.</paragraph><paragraph>For prophylactic infusion, the required number of individual vials of <content styleCode="bold">Dantrium Intravenous</content> should be reconstituted as outlined above.  The contents of individual vials are then transferred to a larger volume sterile intravenous plastic bag.  Stability data on file at Procter &amp; Gamble Pharmaceuticals indicate commercially available sterile plastic bags are acceptable drug delivery devices.  However, it is recommended that the prepared infusion be inspected carefully for cloudiness and/or precipitation prior to dispensing and administration.  Such solutions should not be used.  While stable for 6 hours, it is recommended that the infusion be prepared immediately prior to the anticipated dosage administration time.</paragraph><paragraph>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.</paragraph></text>
