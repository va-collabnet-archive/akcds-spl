<title mediaType="text/x-hl7-title+xml">Mechanisms of Action</title>
<text><paragraph>Cetirizine, a metabolite of hydroxyzine, is an antihistamine; its principal effects are mediated via selective inhibition of H<sub>1</sub> receptors. The antihistaminic activity of cetirizine has been clearly documented in a variety of animal and human models. <content styleCode="italics">In vivo</content> and <content styleCode="italics">Ex vivo</content> animal models have shown negligible anticholinergic and antiserotonergic activity. In clinical trials, however, dry mouth was more common with cetirizine than with placebo. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> receptor binding studies have shown no measurable affinity for other than H<sub>1</sub> receptors. Autoradiographic studies with radiolabeled cetirizine in the rat have shown negligible penetration into the brain. <content styleCode="italics">Ex vivo</content> experiments in the mouse have shown that systemically administered cetirizine does not significantly occupy cerebral H<sub>1</sub> receptors.</paragraph><paragraph>Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is an orally active sympathomimetic amine and exerts a decongestant action on the nasal mucosa. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is recognized as an effective agent for the relief of nasal congestion due to allergic rhinitis. Pseudoephedrine produces peripheral effects similar to those of ephedrine and central effects similar to, but less intense than, amphetamines. It has the potential for excitatory side effects.</paragraph></text>

<title mediaType="text/x-hl7-title+xml">Absorption</title>
<text><paragraph>The bioavailability of cetirizine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride from ZYRTEC-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets is not significantly different from that achieved with separate administration of a cetirizine 5 mg tablet and a pseudoephedrine 120 mg extended release caplet. Co-administration of cetirizine and pseudoephedrine does not significantly affect the bioavailability of either component.</paragraph><paragraph>Following a single dose of the ZYRTEC-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablet, a mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 114 ng/mL at a time (Tmax) of 2.2 hours postdose was observed for cetirizine and a mean Cmax of 309 ng/mL at a Tmax of 4.4 hours postdose was observed for pseudoephedrine.</paragraph><paragraph>When healthy volunteers were administered multiple doses of the ZYRTEC-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablet to reach steady-state concentrations (cetirizine hydrochloride 5 mg and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride 120 mg twice daily for seven days), a mean Cmax of 178 ng/mL was observed for cetirizine and 526 ng/mL for pseudoephedrine.</paragraph><paragraph>Food had no significant effect on the extent of cetirizine absorption (AUC), but Tmax was delayed by 1.8 hours and Cmax was decreased by 30%.  Food had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of pseudoephedrine.  ZYRTEC-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets may be given with or without food (see <content styleCode="bold"><linkHtml href="#Dosage_And_Admin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml></content>).</paragraph></text>

<title mediaType="text/x-hl7-title+xml">Metabolism</title>
<text><paragraph>A human mass balance study of cetirizine in 6 healthy male volunteers indicated that 70% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 10% in the feces. Approximately 50% of the radioactivity was identified in the urine as unchanged drug. Most of the rapid increase in peak plasma radioactivity was associated with parent drug, suggesting low first pass metabolism. Cetirizine is metabolized to a limited extent by oxidative O-dealkylation to a metabolite with negligible antihistaminic activity. The enzyme or enzymes responsible for this metabolism have not been identified.</paragraph><paragraph>One to seven percent of the pseudoephedrine dose appeared to be metabolized to norpseudoephedrine by N-demethylation after a single dose.</paragraph></text>

The pharmacokinetics of cetirizine were similar in patients with mild impairment and normal volunteers. Moderately impaired patients had a 3-fold increase in half-life and a 70% decrease in clearance compared to normal volunteers.</paragraph><paragraph>Patients on hemodialysis (n=5) given a single, 10-mg dose of cetirizine had a 3-fold increase in half life and a 70% decrease in clearance compared to normal volunteers.

<text><paragraph>Trials in 69 adult normal volunteers (aged 20&#8211;61 years) showed that cetirizine at doses of 5 and 10 mg inhibited the skin wheal and flare caused by the intradermal injection of histamine. The onset of this activity after a single 10-mg dose occurred within 20 minutes in 50% of subjects and within one hour in 95% of subjects; this activity persisted for at least 24 hours.  The effects of intradermal injection of various other mediators or histamine releasers were also inhibited by cetirizine. In mildly asthmatic subjects, cetirizine at 5 to 20 mg blocked bronchoconstriction due to nebulized histamine, with virtually total blockade after a 20 mg dose. In trials conducted for up to 12 hours following cutaneous antigen challenge, the late phase recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils, components of the allergic inflammatory response, was inhibited by cetirizine at a dose of 20 mg.  The clinical significance of these findings is not known.</paragraph><paragraph>In four clinical trials in healthy adult males, no clinically significant mean increases in QTc were observed in cetirizine treated subjects. In the first study, a placebo-controlled crossover trial, cetirizine was given at doses up to 60 mg per day, 6 times the maximum clinical dose, for 1 week, and no significant mean QTc prolongation occurred. In the second study, a crossover trial, cetirizine 20 mg and erythromycin (500 mg every 8 hours) were given alone and in combination. There was no significant effect on QTc with the combination or with cetirizine alone. In the third trial, also a crossover study, cetirizine 20 mg and ketoconazole (400 mg per day) were given alone and in combination. Cetirizine caused a mean increase in QTc of 9.1 msec from baseline after 10 days of therapy. Ketoconazole also increased QTc by 8.3 msec. The combination caused an increase of 17.4 msec, equal to the sum of the individual effects. Thus, there was no significant drug interaction on QTc with the combination of cetirizine and ketoconazole. In the fourth study, a placebo-controlled parallel trial, cetirizine 20 mg was given alone or in combination with azithromycin (500 mg as a single dose on the first day followed by 250 mg once daily). There was no significant increase in QTc with cetirizine 20 mg alone or in combination with azithromycin.</paragraph><paragraph>In a six-week, placebo-controlled study of 186 patients (aged 12&#8211;64 years) with allergic rhinitis and mild to moderate asthma, cetirizine 10 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms and did not alter pulmonary function.  This study supports the safety of administering cetirizine to allergic rhinitis patients with mild to moderate asthma.</paragraph></text>

In the two trials, 390 patients were aged 12 to 17 years.  The primary efficacy measure in both trials was the mean change from baseline in the subject-rated Total Symptom Severity Complex (TSSC) score, which included the following symptoms: sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, itchy eyes, watery eyes, postnasal drip, and nasal congestion.  In both trials patients who received <content styleCode="underline">ZYRTEC</content>-D showed a significant reduction in the TSSC score compared to those who received placebo.</paragraph></text>

<title mediaType="text/x-hl7-title+xml">OVERDOSAGE</title>
<text><paragraph>Information regarding acute overdosage is limited to experience with cetirizine alone and the marketing history of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride.</paragraph><paragraph>Overdosage has been reported with cetirizine. In one adult patient who took 150 mg of cetirizine, the patient was somnolent but did not display any other clinical signs or abnormal blood chemistry or hematology results. In an 18-month-old pediatric patient who took an overdose of cetirizine (approximately 180 mg), restlessness and irritability were observed initially; this was followed by drowsiness. Should overdose occur, treatment should be symptomatic or supportive, taking into account any concomitantly ingested medications. There is no known specific antidote to cetirizine. Cetirizine is not effectively removed by dialysis, and dialysis will be ineffective unless a dialyzable agent has been concomitantly ingested. The acute minimal lethal oral doses in mice and rats were 237 and 562 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 95 and 460 times the maximum recommended daily dose in adults on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis). In rodents, the target of acute toxicity was the central nervous system, and the target of multiple-dose toxicity was the liver.</paragraph><paragraph>In large doses, sympathomimetics may give rise to giddiness, headache, nausea, vomiting, sweating, thirst, tachycardia, precordial pain, palpitations, difficulty in micturition, muscular weakness and tenseness, anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia.  Many patients can present a toxic psychosis with delusions and hallucinations.  Some may develop cardiac arrhythmias, circulatory collapse, convulsions, coma and respiratory failure.</paragraph></text>
