									<title mediaType="text/x-hl7-title+xml">Absorption: </title>
									<text>
										<paragraph>The absolute oral bioavailability of mefloquine has not been determined since an intravenous formulation is not available. The bioavailability of the tablet formation compared with an oral solution was over 85%. The presence of food significantly enhances the rate and extent of absorption, leading to about a 40% increase in bioavailability. In healthy volunteers, plasma concentrations peak 6 to 24 hours (median, about 17 hours) after a single dose of mefloquine. In a similar group of volunteers, maximum plasma concentrations in &#181;g/L are roughly equivalent to the dose in milligrams (for example, a single 1000 mg dose produces a maximum concentration of about 1000 &#181;g/L). In healthy volunteers, a dose of 250 mg once weekly, produces maximum steady-state plasma concentrations of 1000 to 2000 &#181;g/L, which are reached after 7 to 10 weeks.</paragraph>

										<paragraph>In healthy adults, the apparent volume of distribution is approximately 20 L/kg, indicating extensive tissue distribution. Mefloquine may accumulate in parasitized erythrocytes. Experiments conducted <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>with human blood using concentrations between 50 and 1000 mg/mL showed a relatively constant erythrocyte-to-plasma concentration ratio of about 2 to 1. The equilibrium reached in less than 30 minutes, was found to be reversible. Protein binding is about 98%. Mefloquine crosses the placenta. Excretion into breast milk appears to be minimal (see PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers).</paragraph>

Maximum plasma concentrations, which were about 50% higher than those of mefloquine, were reached after 2 weeks. Thereafter, plasma levels of the main metabolite and mefloquine declined at a similar rate. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of the main metabolite was 3 to 5 times larger than that of the parent drug. The other metabolite, an alcohol, was present in minute quantities only.</paragraph>

									<text>
										<paragraph>&#160;In several studies in healthy adults, the mean elimination half-life of mefloquine varied between 2 and 4 weeks, with an average of about 3 weeks. Total clearance, which is essentially hepatic, is in the order of 30 mL/min. There is evidence that mefloquine is excreted mainly in the bile and feces. In volunteers, urinary excretion of unchanged mefloquine and its main metabolite under steady-state condition accounted for about 9% and 4% of the dose, respectively. Concentrations of other metabolites could not be measured in the urine.</paragraph>

												<paragraph>No relevant age-related changes have been observed in the pharmacokinetics of mefloquine. Therefore, the dosage for children has been extrapolated from the recommended adult dose. </paragraph>
												<paragraph>No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in patients with renal insufficiency since only a small proportion of the drug is eliminated renally. Mefloquine and its main metabolite are not appreciably removed by hemodialysis. No special chemoprophylactic dosage adjustments are indicated for dialysis patients to achieve concentrations in plasma similar to those in healthy persons.</paragraph>

								<paragraph>Hypersensitivity reactions ranging from mild cutaneous events to anaphylaxis cannot be predicted.</paragraph>
								<paragraph>In patients with epilepsy, mefloquine may increase the risk of convulsions. The drug should therefore be prescribed only for curative treatment in such patients and only if there are compelling medical reasons for its use (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).</paragraph>
								<paragraph>Caution should be exercised with regard to activities requiring alertness and fine motor coordination such as driving, piloting aircraft, operating machinery and deep-sea diving, as dizziness, a loss of balance, or other disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system have been reported during and following the use of mefloquine. These effects may occur after therapy is discontinued due to the long half-life of the drug. Mefloquine should be used with caution in patients with psychiatric disturbances because mefloquine use has been associated with emotional disturbances (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).</paragraph>
								<paragraph>In patients with impaired liver function the elimination of mefloquine may be prolonged, leading to higher plasma levels.</paragraph>
								<paragraph>This drug has been administered for longer than 1 year. If the drug is to be administered for a prolonged period, periodic evaluations including liver function tests should be performed. Although retinal abnormalities seen in humans with long-term chloroquine use have not been observed with mefloquine use, long-term feeding of mefloquine to rats resulted in dose-related ocular lesions (retinal degeneration, retinal edema and lenticular opacity at 12.5 mg/kg/day and higher) (see ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY). Therefore, periodic ophthalmic examinations are recommended.</paragraph>
								<paragraph>Parenteral studies in animals show that mefloquine, a myocardial depressant, possesses 20% of the antifibrillatory action of quinidine and produces 50% of the increase in the PR interval reported with quinine. The effect of mefloquine on the compromised cardiovascular system has not been evaluated. However, transitory and clinically silent ECG alterations have been reported during the use of mefloquine. Alterations included sinus bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia, first degree AV-block, prolongation of the QTc interval and abnormal T waves (see also cardiovascular effects under PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS). The benefits of mefloquine therapy should be weighed against the possibility of adverse effects in patients with cardiac disease.</paragraph>

							<text>
								<paragraph>Drug-drug interactions with mefloquine have not been explored in detail. There is one report of cardiopulmonary arrest, with full recovery, in a patient who was taking a beta blocker (propranolol) (see PRECAUTIONS: General). The effects of mefloquine on the compromised cardiovascular system have not been evaluated. The benefits of mefloquine therapy should be weighed against the possibility of adverse effects in patients with cardiac disease.</paragraph>
								<paragraph>Because of the danger of a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval, halofantrine must not be given simultaneously with or subsequent to mefloquine (see WARNINGS).</paragraph>
								<paragraph>Concomitant administration of mefloquine and other related compounds (e.g., quinine, quinidine and chloroquine) may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities and increase the risk of convulsions (see WARNINGS). If these drugs are to be used in the initial treatment of severe malaria, mefloquine administration should be delayed at least 12 hours after the last dose. There is evidence that the use of halofantrine after mefloquine causes a significant lengthening of the QTc interval. Clinically significant QTc prolongation has not been found with mefloquine alone.</paragraph>
								<paragraph>This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with mefloquine, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (e.g., anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H<sub>1</sub>-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval. There are no data that conclusively establish whether the concomitant administration of mefloquine and the above listed agents has an effect on cardiac function.</paragraph>
								<paragraph>In patients taking an anticonvulsant (e.g., valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin), the concomitant use of mefloquine may reduce seizure control by lowering the plasma levels of the anticonvulsant. Therefore, patients concurrently taking antiseizure medication and mefloquine should have the blood level of their antiseizure medication monitored and the dosage adjusted appropriately (see PRECAUTIONS: General).</paragraph>
								<paragraph>When mefloquine is taken concurrently with oral live typhoid vaccines, attenuation of immunization cannot be excluded. Vaccinations with attenuated live bacteria should therefore be completed at least 3 days before the first dose of mefloquine.</paragraph>
								<paragraph>No other drug interactions are known. Nevertheless, the effects of mefloquine on travelers receiving comedication, particularly diabetics or patients using anticoagulants, should be checked before departure.</paragraph>
								<paragraph>In clinical trials, the concomitant administration of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine did not alter the adverse reaction profile.</paragraph>

							<item>
								<content styleCode="bold">Take Mefloquine exactly as prescribed to prevent malaria.</content>
								<br/>Malaria is an infection that can cause death, and is spread to humans through mosquito bites. If you travel to parts of the world where the mosquitoes carry the malaria parasite, you must take a malaria prevention medicine. Mefloquine is one of a small number of medications approved to prevent and to treat malaria. If taken correctly, mefloquine is effective at preventing malaria but, like all medications, it may produce side effects in some patients.</item>
							<item>
								<content styleCode="bold">Mefloquine can rarely cause serious mental problems in some patients.</content>
								<br/>The most frequently reported side effects with mefloquine, such as nausea, difficulty sleeping, and bad dreams are usually mild and do not cause people to stop taking the medicine. However, people taking mefloquine occasionally experience severe anxiety, feelings that people are against them, hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there, for example), depression, unusual behavior, or feeling disoriented. There have been reports that in some patients these side effects continue after mefloquine is stopped. Some patients taking mefloquine think about killing themselves, and there have been rare reports of suicides. It is not known whether mefloquine was responsible for these suicides.</item>
							<item>
								<content styleCode="bold">You need to take malaria prevention medicine before you travel to a malaria</content>
								<content styleCode="bold">area, while you are in a malaria area, and after you return from a malaria area.</content>
								<br/>Medicines approved in the United States for malaria prevention include mefloquine, doxycycline, atovaquone/proguanil, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine. Not all of these drugs work equally as well in all areas of the world where there is malaria. The chloroquines, for example, do not work in areas where the malaria parasite has developed resistance to chloroquine. Mefloquine may be effective against malaria that is resistant to chloroquine or other drugs. All drugs to treat malaria have side effects that are different for each one. For example, some may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight (mefloquine does not do this). However, if you use mefloquine to prevent malaria and you develop a sudden onset of anxiety, depression, restlessness, confusion (possible signs of more serious mental problems), or you develop other serious side effects, contact a doctor or other healthcare provider. It may be necessary to stop taking mefloquine and use another malaria prevention medicine instead. If you can&#8217;t get another medicine, leave the malaria area. However, be aware that leaving the malaria area may not protect you from getting malaria. You still need to take a malaria prevention medicine.</item>

								<content styleCode="bold">Find out whether you need malaria prevention. </content>Before you travel, talk with your prescriber about your travel plans to determine whether you need to take medicine to prevent malaria. Even in those countries where malaria is present, there may be areas of the country that are free of malaria. In general, malaria is more common in rural (country) areas than in big cities, and it is more common during rainy seasons, when mosquitoes are most common. You can get information about the areas of the world where malaria occurs from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and from local authorities in the countries you visit. If possible, plan your travel to reduce the risk of malaria.</item>

								<content styleCode="bold">Take medicine to prevent malaria infection. </content>Without malaria prevention medicine, you have a higher risk of getting malaria. Malaria starts with flu-like symptoms, such as chills, fever, muscle pains, and headaches. However, malaria can make you very sick or cause death if you don&#8217;t seek medical help immediately. These symptoms may disappear for a while, and you may think you are well. But, the symptoms return later and then it may be too late for successful treatment.<br/>Malaria can cause confusion, coma, and seizures. It can cause kidney failure, breathing problems, and severe damage to red blood cells. However, malaria can be easily diagnosed with a blood test, and if caught in time, can be effectively treated<br/>

								<content styleCode="bold">after you return from a malaria area, </content>get medical help right away and tell your prescriber that you may have been exposed to malaria.<br/>People who have lived for many years in areas with malaria may have some immunity to malaria (they do not get it as easily) and may not take malaria prevention medicine. This does not mean that you don&#8217;t need to take malaria</item>

								<content styleCode="bold">Protect against mosquito bites. </content>Medicines do not always completely prevent your catching malaria from mosquito bites. So protect yourself very well against mosquitoes. Cover your skin with long sleeves and long pants, and use mosquito repellent and bed nets while in malaria areas. If you are out in the bush, you may want to pre-wash your clothes with permethrin. This is a mosquito repellent that may be effective for weeks after use. Ask your prescriber for other ways to protect yourself.</item>
